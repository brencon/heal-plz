# LLM Council Configuration
# ==========================
# Copy this file to config.yaml and customize for your project.
#
# Based on: https://github.com/karpathy/llm-council

# Council Members
# ---------------
# Define which LLM models participate in council deliberations.
# You need at least 2 members with valid API keys for the council to function.
#
# Supported providers:
#   - anthropic: Claude models (requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
#   - openai: GPT models (requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
#   - google: Gemini models (requires GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY)
#   - xai: Grok models (requires XAI_API_KEY)

council:
  members:
    # Anthropic Claude
    - provider: anthropic
      model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
      name: "Claude Sonnet"

    # OpenAI GPT
    - provider: openai
      model: gpt-4o
      name: "GPT-4o"

    # Google Gemini
    - provider: google
      model: gemini-2.0-flash
      name: "Gemini 2.0"

    # xAI Grok (uncomment if you have access)
    # - provider: xai
    #   model: grok-2
    #   name: "Grok 2"

  # Chairman Model
  # --------------
  # The chairman synthesizes all council responses into a final recommendation.
  # Choose a model you trust for balanced, thoughtful synthesis.
  chairman:
    provider: anthropic
    model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
    name: "Chairman (Claude)"

# Cost Optimization
# -----------------
# Control costs by using cheaper/faster models for certain stages.
cost_optimization:
  # Use fast models for peer review stage (Stage 2)
  # This significantly reduces costs while maintaining quality for synthesis
  use_fast_models_for_review: true

  # Override models for cost-sensitive operations
  # These are used when use_fast_models_for_review is true
  fast_model_overrides:
    anthropic: claude-3-5-haiku-latest    # ~10x cheaper than Opus
    openai: gpt-4o-mini                    # ~15x cheaper than GPT-4o
    google: gemini-2.0-flash               # Often has free tier
    xai: grok-2                            # Use same model if no cheaper option

# Default Behavior
# ----------------
defaults:
  # Default deliberation mode:
  #   - quick: Just gather responses (fastest, cheapest)
  #   - full: Full three-stage process (most thorough)
  #   - vote: Focus on peer review and ranking
  mode: full

  # Timeout for individual API calls (seconds)
  timeout_seconds: 60

  # Maximum retries for failed API calls
  max_retries: 2


# Example Alternative Configurations
# ==================================

# Budget Configuration (minimal cost)
# -----------------------------------

#       model: gpt-4o-mini
#       name: "GPT-4o Mini"
#   chairman:
#     provider: anthropic
#     model: claude-3-5-haiku-latest
# cost_optimization:
#   use_fast_models_for_review: true

# Premium Configuration (best quality)
