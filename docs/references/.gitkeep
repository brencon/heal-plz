# References Directory

Store external references, whitepapers, and research materials here.
These documents provide Claude with additional context when needed.

## Small Files (Markdown, Text)

Reference from CLAUDE.md using: @docs/references/[filename]

## Large PDFs

For PDFs too large for Claude Code to read directly, use the PDF parser:

```bash
# Parse a PDF into semantic markdown
/parse-pdf docs/references/large-spec.pdf

# Or via CLI
python scripts/pdf-parser/parse_pdf.py docs/references/large-spec.pdf
```

This creates a structured knowledge base:

```
docs/references/large-spec/
├── _index.md                    # Overview and navigation
├── 01-introduction/
│   ├── overview.md
│   └── images/
├── 02-topic/
│   ├── subtopic.md
│   └── images/
└── ...
```

Then reference in CLAUDE.md:
```markdown
- For spec documentation, see: @docs/references/large-spec/_index.md
```

## Tips

- Keep original PDFs here (or use git-lfs for very large files)
- Parsed markdown directories are version controlled
- Re-run the parser if the source PDF is updated
