# Plan Feature Implementation

Before implementing, search the codebase and create a detailed plan.

## Instructions

1. **Understand the Request**: Analyze what "$ARGUMENTS" means in the context of this project
2. **Search the Codebase**: Find related files, patterns, and existing implementations
3. **Identify Dependencies**: What existing code will this interact with?
4. **Propose Options**: Present 2-3 implementation approaches with tradeoffs
5. **Recommend**: Suggest the best approach based on project patterns

## Output Format

Provide:
- Summary of what needs to be built
- Files that will be created or modified
- Step-by-step implementation plan
- Potential risks or considerations
- Questions that need clarification

**Do NOT start implementing until the plan is approved.**
