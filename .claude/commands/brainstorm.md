# Brainstorm Ideas

I want to brainstorm before implementing: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

Before any planning or coding, let's explore options together.

Please:
1. **Understand the goal**: What am I trying to achieve?
2. **Explore approaches**: What are 3-4 different ways to implement this?
3. **Consider tradeoffs**: What are the pros/cons of each approach?
4. **Suggest enhancements**: What related features or improvements could we add?
5. **Ask questions**: What clarifications would help refine the approach?

## Output Format

Present options as a numbered list I can choose from, like:
1. **[Approach Name]**: Description and tradeoffs
2. **[Approach Name]**: Description and tradeoffs
3. **[Hybrid/Alternative]**: Description and tradeoffs

After I choose, we can switch to plan mode to build it out.

**Do NOT start planning or coding yet. This is brainstorming only.**
