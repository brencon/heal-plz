# Generate Tests

Create comprehensive tests for: $ARGUMENTS

## Test Generation Guidelines

1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the function/module being tested
2. **Identify Test Cases**:
   - Happy path scenarios
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Error conditions and exceptions
   - Integration points

3. **Follow Project Patterns**: Use existing test files as reference
4. **Aim for Coverage**: Cover all code paths and branches

## Test Structure

Use the project's established testing patterns. Include:

- Descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Appropriate mocking for external dependencies
- Setup and teardown as needed

## Output

Provide:
- Test file(s) with complete, runnable tests
- Explanation of test coverage
- Any edge cases that couldn't be tested and why
- Command to run the new tests
